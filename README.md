# The "Database as Code" Manifesto

- Treat your database or other storage system as a code
- All changes and operations with database and all queries to database should be expressed as a plain old code
- Git (or anything else VCS) is a single source of truth for database code
- SQL actually is a main database language supported by almost all DBMS 
- SQL is not a bytecode for your data and your database, it's a normal human-oriented program language
- SQL is designed not only for data, but also for metadata
- Database code is not only DDL and other migration scripts, DML and all kinds of SQL scripts too
- Database code is a normal code and it also needs static analysys, code review (especialy by DBA, analysts and business people) , tests and automation of it all.
